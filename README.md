This is free open source version of our commercial product - Web based IBM 5250 telnet client for IBM iSeries servers (AS/400).

This free open source version is based on open sourced tn5250j library as a connector between Java server and IBM machine. Tn5250j is thread based library not optimized for server and cloud environments and thus not recommended for production environments.

First version was published in 2010. but after many request for improvement, we've decided to create a full featured commercial product which was written from scratch and it is based on modern event based networking having high performance, security, integration, technical support, mobile apps, pdf spool printing and many more incoming features in mind.   

Even this free version is good for small teams and basic operations, it is not recommended to use it in real production environment. This free version is not optimized for high traffic and large number of users where a lot of sessions are needed.

For this version we do not provide any kind of support, updates and improvements based on user request. From time to time we will publish bug fixes.

For full technical support and version that is optimized for large amount of connections, there is a commercial version available which also include periodical updates and new features, SLA, mobile apps, cloud ready deployment and many more.

Only commercial version is battle tested in real working production environment.
